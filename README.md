## Description of the project
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the **AirBnB clone**. The aim of the project is to deploy a replica of the [Airbnb Website](https://www.airbnb.com/) using my server. The final version of this project will have:
- ```A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like a shell (for development and debugging)```
- ```A website (front-end) with static and dynamic functionalities```
- ```A comprehensive database to manage the backend functionalities```
- ```An API that provides a communication interface between the front and backend of the system.```
